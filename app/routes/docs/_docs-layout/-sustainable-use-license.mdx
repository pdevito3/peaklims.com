Peak LIMS's [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/peaklims/peaklims/blob/main/LICENSE.md) and [Peak LIMS Enterprise License](https://github.com/peaklims/peaklims/blob/main/LICENSE_EE.md) are based on the [fair-code](http://faircode.io/) model.

## License FAQs

### What license do you use?

Peak LIMS uses the [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/peaklims/peaklims/blob/main/LICENSE.md) and
[Peak LIMS Enterprise License](https://github.com/peaklims/peaklims/blob/main/LICENSE_EE.md). These licenses
are based on the [fair-code](http://faircode.io/) model and adapted from [n8n's Sustainable Use License](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/).

This page will cover details on the Sustainable Use License. For more information on the plans available for Enterprise License usage, please refer to the [pricing page](/pricing).

### What source code is covered by the Sustainable Use License?

The [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/peaklims/peaklims/blob/main/LICENSE.md) applies to all our public source code hosted in our 
[main GitHub repository](https://github.com/peaklims), except for:

- Content of branches other than `main`.
- Source code files that contain `.ee.` in their file name. These are licensed under the Peak LIMS Enterprise License.

### What is the Sustainable Use License?

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code software license created by [n8n](https://n8n.io/) in 2022 and adapted for Peak LIMS. You can read more about 
why we chose this type of license [here](#why-did-you-create-a-license). The license allows you the free right to use, modify, create
 derivative works, and redistribute, with two limitations:

- You may use, distribute, or modify the software only for for non-competing commercial, non-commercial, or personal use.
- You may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices of the licensor in the software. Any 
use of the licensor's trademarks is subject to applicable law.

We encourage anyone who wants to use the Sustainable Use License. If you are building something out in the open, it makes sense to 
think about licensing earlier in order to avoid problems later. 

### What is and isn't allowed under the Sustainable Use License in the context of the Peak LIMS product?

Our license restricts use to "non-competing commercial use". In practice this means all use is allowed unless you are using the code for 
a product, service, or module in which the value derives entirely or substantially from Peak LIMS functionality in a way that would compete 
with Peak LIMS business. Here are some examples that wouldn't be allowed:

- White-labeling Peak LIMS and using it in your company as a LIMS (you can do this through our [forking program](/forking) though) or offering it to your customers for money.
- Hosting Peak LIMS and charging people money to access it.
- Using Peak LIMS code for a custom internal LIMS at your company.

All of the following examples are allowed under our license:

- Using Peak LIMS code for an internal tool or offering outside of the LIMS space.
- Deploying Peak LIMS in non-production environments internally at your company to trial Peak LIMS with non-production data.
- Using Peak LIMS code for a personal project.

### What if I want to use Peak LIMS for something that's not permitted by the license?

You must sign a separate commercial agreement with us. This could be through our traditional SaaS offering or through our forking program.
We understand that labs may want to have an extra level of custom control over their LIMS and actively encourage teams to grow their own
flavor of Peak LIMS within their organizations; we just ask them to sign an agreement laying out the terms of use, and the fees owed to Peak 
LIMS for using the product in this way. We call this mode of use Peak LIMS Fork. You can learn more, and contact us 
about it [here](/forking).

If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at 
[the examples](#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-sustainable-use-license-in-the-context-of-the-peak-lims-product), and 
if you're still unclear, email us at [peaklims@gmail.com](mailto:peaklims@gmail.com).

### Why don't you use an open source license?

The modern software space is built on the backs of others and the current OSS model is broken. We don't want to limit our software to 
this same old broken model and instead want to make Peak LIMS as widely and freely available as possible for users, while ensuring 
we can build a sustainable, viable business. By making our product free to use, easy to distribute, and source-available we help 
everyone access the product. By operating as a business, we can continue to release features, fix bugs, and provide reliable 
software at scale long-term.

### Why did you create a license?

Creating a license was our least favorite option. We only went down this path after reviewing the possible existing licenses and
 deciding nothing fit our specific needs. There are two ways in which we try to mitigate the pain and friction of using a proprietary license:

1. By using plain English, and keeping it as short as possible.
2. By promoting [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) with the goal of making it a well-known umbrella term to describe software models like ours.

Our goals when we created the Sustainable Use License were:

1. To be as permissive as possible.
2. Safeguarding our ability to build a business.
3. Being as clear as possible what use was permitted or not.

### My company has a policy against using code that restricts commercial use - can I still use Peak LIMS?

Provided you have purchased a Peak LIMS Enterprise License or are not using Peak LIMS for a competing 
commercial purpose to Peak LIMS, you should be able to use code from Peak LIMS. If you are unsure whether the use 
case you have meets this criteria or not, take a look at [the examples](#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-sustainable-use-license-in-the-context-of-the-peak-lims-product), 
and if you're still unclear, email us at [peaklims@gmail.com](mailto:peaklims@gmail.com).

### What happens to the code I contribute to Peak LIMS in light of the Sustainable Use License?

Any code you contribute on GitHub is subject to GitHub's [terms of use](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#d-user-generated-content). 
In simple terms, this means you own, and are responsible for, anything you contribute, but that you 
grant other GitHub users certain rights to use this code. When you contribute code to a repository 
containing notice of a license, you license the code under the same terms.

Peak LIMS asks every contributor to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/peaklims/peaklims/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md). 
In addition to the above, this gives Peak LIMS the ability to change its license without seeking additional permission. 
It also means you aren't liable for your contributions (e.g. in case they cause damage to someone else's business).

{/* It's easy to get started contributing code to Peak LIMS [here](https://github.com/PeakLIMS-io), and we've listed broader 
ways of participating in our community [here](https://docs.Peak LIMS.io/reference/contributing.html). */}

### Is Peak LIMS open source?

Although the Peak LIMS source code is available under the Sustainable Use License, according to the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) (OSI), 
open source licenses can't include limitations on use, so we do not call ourselves open source. In practice, 
Peak LIMS offers most users many of the same benefits as OSI-approved open source.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) coined the term ['fair-code'](https://faircode.io/) as a way of describing their licensing model and the model of 
other companies who are source-available, but restrict commercial use of their source code. We have adopted this terminology as well.

### What is fair-code, and how does the Sustainable Use License relate to it?

Fair-code isn't a software license. It describes a software model where software:

- Is generally free to use and can be distributed by anybody.
- Has its source code openly available.
- Can be extended by anybody in public and private communities.
- Is commercially restricted by its authors.

The Sustainable Use License is a fair-code license. You can read more about it and see other examples of fair-code licenses [here](https://faircode.io/).

### Can I use the Peak LIMS Sustainable Use License for my own project?

Yes! As a matter of fact, this license is adapted from [n8n's Sustainable Use License](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/) as well! 
We're excited to see more software use the Sustainable Use License.

## Special Thanks

A special thanks to [n8n](https://n8n.io/) for the foundation of this licensing model based on their own [Sustainable Use License](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/) offering.
